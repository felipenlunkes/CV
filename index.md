## Personal profile and professional goals

<div align="justify">

Acting as a **backend developer** at UbiSafe/Orsegups Participações S/A.

Backend software developer working on project development using, among other technologies, **Java**, **Spring Framework**, **Spring Boot**, **MySQL**, **JavaScript/TypeScript**, **Docker**, **Linux**, **Apache Kafka**, **Kinesis** and **microservices architecture**.

I have experience in implementing projects using several languages, the main ones being: x86 Assembly, Java, C, Python and shell scripts (see my open source projects below, in the [Projects and portfolio section](https://felipenlunkes.github.io/cv/#projects-and-portfolio)). I am proficient in using several tools, such as code control through git, GNU Compiler Collection, various assemblers, such as flat assembler (fasm), NASM and GNU as, virtualization tools, such as Docker and QEMU, and emulation. Experience in managing and documenting open source projects and in the use and administration of Unix-like systems. I have been continuously improving myself in Java, C, Rust, Python and x86 Assembly and since 2015 I have been developing an original operating system project (Hexagonix, which you can find below, in the [Projects and portfolio section](https://felipenlunkes.github.io/cv/#projects-and-portfolio)) completely written in x86 Assembly, as well as others low-level projects.

I am graduating in Systems Analysis and Development (*Análise e Desenvolvimento de Sistemas - ADS*) from the *Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais* (PUC Minas, Brazil). I have a technical course in IT, where I became familiar with the notions of programming logic, C, Java, Pascal, Delphi, VisualBasic, hardware, robotics, web development, relational databases and SQL, systems analysis and entrepreneurship. I worked as a IT and technology democratization instructor, alongside the federal government program Telecentros.BR. I worked as a freelancer in software development (using Java and C with integration to MySQL databases) and computer maintenance. Furthermore, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from the *Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais* (UFMG, Brazil), with an emphasis on Biotechnology and Health, with a focus on the areas of Bioinformatics, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and I have an academic master's degree (stricto sensu) in Health Sciences by the *Instituto René Rachou/Fiocruz Minas* (Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Brazil). See my [academic background](https://felipenlunkes.github.io/cv/#academic-background) below.

I am interested in preservation, documentation and emulation of historical software, having a large collection of operating systems collected over the years. See other [interests](https://felipenlunkes.github.io/cv/#interests) below.

  - Use of Python to create a frontend for tools that run on the command line. Mainly using Tkinter and derivatives, targeting Linux and FreeBSD (WSL on Windows is also supported);
  - Creating small programs to study algorithms in Python;

* Shell script:

  - [**freebsd-config**](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/freebsd-config) | **2022-currently**

    - The project relies on a shell script designed to automate the installation of various packages after installing FreeBSD. By default, installing FreeBSD does not install graphics and network drivers, as well as GNU utilities and a GUI. The script aims to automate network and graphics configuration, ask the user to choose one of several graphical environments to install and install GNU tools, such as bash and nano, for example.

  - [**Run Ancient UNIX**](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/run-ancient-unix) | **2022-currently**

    - This project/repository aims to facilitate the execution of old versions of UNIX, developed for discontinued architectures, such as PDP-11. This includes the Version 1 UNIX, Version 5 UNIX, and Version 7 UNIX historical versions. The project includes a script and a Python frontend responsible for downloading disk images of old UNIX versions, as well as preparing these images to run on modern architectures.

#### Sorted by other technologies

* Linux:

  - Netuno OS | **2012-2014**

    - During 2012, motivated to learn more about how a modern operating system works, I started to develop a small and simple Linux distribution, choosing to maintain a command line interface. For that, I followed the steps proposed by the Linux From Scratch project. The result was Netuno OS, an operating system based on the 2.6 series Linux kernel, standard tools and utilities. There are no sources other than those available for the packages used, so a repository had not been created at the time. What was left of it was an installation image of the system, approximately 192 Mb, dated 2012 and updated in 2014. At the moment, I also developed some kernel modules to study the interfaces and use of the /proc directory.
