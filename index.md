## Personal profile and professional goals

<p align="justify">
Interested in acting as a backend developer (in C, Python, Java and SQL), or as a DevOps developer. I have experience in project development using C, Python, Java and x86 Assembly languages, as well as code maintenance in the git system. Experience and mastery of Unix-like systems such as Linux, FreeBSD and macOS, as well as shell scripting. Graduated as a computer technician (2013) and graduated in Biological Sciences (emphasis in Biotechnology and Health) from UFMG. In my spare time, I'm interested in studying and developing operating systems and associated projects, as well as projects in low-level programming. I always try to update myself in the most used languages ​​and frameworks. I'm looking for my first opportunity in the development market and to improve myself in the area, applying what I've learned from my projects to products.

## Projects, portfolio and technologies

<div align="justify">

* C:
  - Development of an operating system (PX-DOS) derived from the Public Domain Operating System;
  - Development of an operating system from scratch (Lunix OS), to practice programming logic and software structure in C;

* Python:
  - Use of Python to create a frontend for tools that run on the command line. Mainly using Tkinter and derivatives, targeting Linux and FreeBSD (WSL on Windows is also supported);
  - Creating small programs to study algorithms in Python;

In addition to the kernel, I have developed a series of tools, utilities and libraries that allow the system to be expanded by anyone interested. The aim of the project was to practice logic that could be applied in any high-level language. In addition, I wrote extensive documentation in Portuguese and English. More at: github.com/hexagonix;
  - Creation of a basic operating system (Bin OS) in 2013, to practice baremetal programming.
