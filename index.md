## Personal profile and professional goals

<div align="justify">

Interested in acting as a **backend developer** (in C, Python, Java and SQL), or as **a DevOps developer**. I have experience in project development using C, Python, Java and x86 Assembly languages, as well as code maintenance in the git system. Experience and mastery of Unix-like systems such as Linux, FreeBSD and macOS, as well as shell scripting. Graduated as a computer technician (2013) and graduated in Biological Sciences (emphasis in Biotechnology and Health) from UFMG (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais - Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil). In my spare time, I'm interested in studying and developing operating systems and associated projects, as well as projects in low-level programming. I always try to update myself in the most used languages ​​and frameworks. I'm looking for my first opportunity in the development market and to improve myself in the area, applying what I've learned from my projects to products.

In addition to the kernel, I've developed a series of tools, utilities and libraries that allow the system to be expanded by anyone interested. The aim of the project was to practice logic that could be applied in any high-level language. In addition, I wrote extensive documentation in Portuguese and English. More at: **[github.com/hexagonix](https://github.com/hexagonix)**;
