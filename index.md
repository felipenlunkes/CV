## Personal profile and professional goals

<div align="justify">

Acting as a **backend Jr. developer** at UbiSafe/Orsegups Participações S/A.

Backend developer with experience in implementing projects using x86 Assembly, C, Java and Python, using tools such as git, gcc, nasm, fasm and virtualization tools (see below my open source projects, in the projects section). Experience managing and documenting open source projects. I have experience in using and administering Unix-like systems, such as Linux, FreeBSD and macOS, as well as developing shell scripts. In my spare time, I try to improve myself in Java, C and Rust, in addition to developing an operating system project (Hexagonix, which you can find below, in the projects section), as well as low-level projects. I have a growing interest in Go.

I have technical training in informatics and I worked as an instructor of informatics and technology democratization for students of all ages, with the federal government program Telecentros.BR (Brazil). I worked as a freelancer in software development (using Java and C with integration to MySQL databases) and computer maintenance (laptops and desktops).

I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), with an emphasis on Biotechnology and Health, focusing on the areas of Bioinformatics, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and I have an academic master's degree (strictu sensu) in Health Sciences from the Instituto René Rachou/Fiocruz Minas (Fundação Oswaldo Cruz).

I am interested in preservation, documentation and emulation of historical software, having a large collection of operating systems collected over the years.

  - [**PX-DOS**](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/PX-DOS) | **2013-2015**

    - PX-DOS is derived from an older version of a DOS system, the Public Domain Operating System (PDOS). PX-DOS adds new layers, abstractions and functions on top of PDOS and extends its functionality. Several new utilities (userland) have also been added to the base system. System components were divided into repositories. We have the repository which contains the kernel, boot loader and shell, which contains the system init (user mode) and system utilities. We also have the repository with the assembly and libc development libraries.

  - [**PXBAS**](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/PXBAS) | **2011-2013**

    - PXBAS is a simple BASIC interpreter for MS-DOS, FreeDOS, PX-DOS, PDOS and compatibles. It may work on 32-bit versions of Windows.

* Assembly:

  - [**Hexagonix OS**](https://github.com/hexagonix) | **2015-currently**

    - Hexagonix is ​​a simple and lightweight operating system, Unix-like and completely developed in x86 Assembly. Hexagonix is ​​composed by a simple monolithic kernel, called Hexagon, shell, Unix-like utilities developed in Assembly and libraries for the development of other utilities. In addition, it is self-hosting, with a port of the fasm assembler (flat assembler), the same used for its construction. It operates in 32-bit protected mode, with FAT16 support, Pentium III or higher processors and 32 MB of RAM or more. It can be installed on a physical machine, running natively. The system aims to be simple and fast, based on some concepts of the Unix philosophy, in addition to being licensed under the BSD-3-Clause license, a permissive free software license. At the moment, all the project documentation is in Portuguese and English, while the code comments are in Portuguese. Hexagonix has extensive documentation covering many system, language, and hardware features. Documentation can be found at: github.com/hexagonix/Doc. The project also aims to be an educational tool, with well-commented code.

  - [**Bin S.O**](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/Bin-S.O) | **2011-2013**

    - My first operating system project developed entirely in Assembly x86. The system implements a simple file system, called BinFS, based on a linked list of files. The file system is created using a tool developed in C, which creates a disk image. Bin OS runs in 16-bit real mode and supports the development of utilities using assembly libraries. The system can be installed on devices to run natively, through an installer running on a Linux LiveCD (Netuno OS).

  - [**Asm-MIPS**](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/MIPS-asm) | **2018**

    - MIPS Assembly code written by me for the Discipline of Computer Organization I (DCC006) at the Computer Science Department of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), in 2018. The code can be executed in the MARS MIPS Simulator.

* Python:

  - [**Python-exp**](https://github.com/felipenlunkes?tab=repositories) | **2021-currently**

    - General purpose tools developed in Python to automate or facilitate tasks performed at the command line. Also, in-language learning utilities like BMI calculator. The projects are distributed among several repositories on my GitHub.

  - Use of Python to create a frontend for tools that run on the command line. Mainly using
  Tkinter and derivatives, targeting Linux and FreeBSD (WSL on Windows is also supported);
  - Creating small programs to study algorithms in Python;

* C++:

  - [**Arduino**](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/AxiomKernel) | **2012-2018**

    - This is one of the Arduino based projects developed between 2012-2018. Other projects can be found among my repositories on GitHub.

* Shell script:

  - [**freebsd-config**](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/freebsd-config) | **2022-currently**

    - The project relies on a shell script designed to automate the installation of various packages after installing FreeBSD. By default, installing FreeBSD does not install graphics and network drivers, as well as GNU utilities and a GUI. The script aims to automate network and graphics configuration, ask the user to choose one of several graphical environments to install and install GNU tools, such as bash and nano, for example.

  - [**Run Ancient UNIX**](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/run-ancient-unix) | **2022-currently**

    - This project/repository aims to facilitate the execution of old versions of UNIX, developed for discontinued architectures, such as PDP-11. This includes the Version 1 UNIX, Version 5 UNIX, and Version 7 UNIX historical versions. The project includes a script and a Python frontend responsible for downloading disk images of old UNIX versions, as well as preparing these images to run on modern architectures.

* Markdown:

  - [**osdev**](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/osdev) | **2021-currently**

    - osdev is a project that aims to catalog and obtain more information about active open source operating system projects, as well as providing selected material that can help in the development of independent operating system projects. Therefore, all projects are classified according to operating system family, target architecture, whether they are available on GitHub or not, whether they are active (with commits less than 4 years old) and software license. In addition, the repository seeks to raise and organize historical material on the most used operating systems or those that revolutionized computing, such as UNIX.

  - [**My Resume**](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/cv/tree/main/resumes) | **2022-2023**

    - This resume was entirely developed in Markdown and converted into PDF with the `pandoc` utility.

* Linux:

  - Netuno OS | **2012-2014**

    - During 2012, motivated to learn more about how a modern operating system works, I started to develop a small and simple Linux distribution, choosing to maintain a command line interface. For that, I followed the steps proposed by the Linux From Scratch project. The result was Netuno OS, an operating system based on the 2.6 series Linux kernel, standard tools and utilities. There are no sources other than those available for the packages used, so a repository had not been created at the time. What was left of it was an installation image of the system, approximately 192 Mb, dated 2012 and updated in 2014. At the moment, I also developed some kernel modules to study the interfaces and use of the /proc directory.
